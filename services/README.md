# Services

This directory contains backend services and APIs that are part of the Troupe Inc. universe.

## Structure

Each service should have its own directory with:
- A descriptive name
- Its own README.md with API documentation
- Source code and configuration
- Tests
- Deployment instructions

## Adding a New Service

When adding a new service:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Add comprehensive documentation including API endpoints
3. Include deployment and scaling instructions
4. Provide environment configuration examples
5. Update the main [PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md) file
6. Document dependencies and integrations

## Guidelines

- Follow microservices best practices
- Document all API endpoints
- Include health check endpoints
- Provide monitoring and logging
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Include container/deployment configurations
