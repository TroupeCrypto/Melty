# Libraries

This directory contains shared libraries and utilities used across the Troupe Inc. universe.

## Structure

Each library should have its own directory with:
- A clear, descriptive name
- Its own README.md with API documentation
- Well-tested code
- Version information
- Examples of usage

## Adding a New Library

When adding a new library:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Add comprehensive documentation
3. Include tests with good coverage
4. Follow semantic versioning
5. Update the main [PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md) file
6. Document dependencies and compatibility

## Guidelines

- Keep libraries focused on a single responsibility
- Provide clear public APIs
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Include usage examples
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document breaking changes in releases
