# Apps

This directory contains standalone applications that are part of the Troupe Inc. universe.

## Structure

Each application should have its own directory with:
- A descriptive name
- Its own README.md with setup and usage instructions
- Source code organized appropriately
- Tests
- Configuration files

## Adding a New App

When adding a new application:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Add a comprehensive README.md
3. Include all necessary dependencies and build instructions
4. Update the main [PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md) file
5. Ensure tests are included and passing

## Guidelines

- Keep applications self-contained when possible
- Use shared libraries from `../libs/` for common functionality
- Follow consistent naming and structure conventions
- Document deployment and configuration requirements
